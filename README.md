# Wireless-Measurement-Project
My Wireless Measurement project involves an automatic watering system for a
 plant. I used a capacitive water sensor to gather information about the soil’s
 moisture percentage. After collecting data for nearly two months, I identified
 a threshold of around 60%, at which point a simulated pump should activate
 to increase the moisture level. All data is also transferred to the Arduino IoT
 Cloud platform, allowing remote monitoring of the plant’s moisture levels.
